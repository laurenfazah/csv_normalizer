# CSV Normalizer

This is a Ruby project fully-tested with RSpec.

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:laurenfazah/csv_normalizer.git
```

Within project root, tests can be run using `rspec`.

> If `rspec` is not installed on your machine, do so using `gem install rspec`.

There is a runner file preloaded to load and normalize the CSV `sample.csv` living in `/data`.

To run the runner from the commandline:

```
ruby lib/runner.rb
```
